1) Program 1 labelled as "py1": Is a program that opens a file and reads it elements as per the file given in the "Task 1" i alloted the name "sample.txt" to my file. It reads the file line by line by using the "readline" function and i also used "for"  loop in order to make program more neat. i also used "try and except" as i learnt in "Module 11" which handle errors gracefully if the file doe not exist rather than crashing the whoel program. 

2) Program 2 labelled as "py2": Is a program that opens the file
